various repairs on the garmin forerunner 610
# disassembly
1. remove FOUR pins. The pins hold the watchband. I have the nylon band, and the pins that held the strap were separate from the ones that held the hard plastic pieces between the band and watch. Hold the watch firmly. Remove the tapered pins by lightly tapping a metal drift with a hammerish object.
2. remove SIX case screws. They're torx T-5's. Mine had plenty of corrosion, but were easy to remove.
3. remove the back, and disconnect the 6-pin plastic connector by lifting it UP, away from the watch. It doesn't "plug in" like molex or JST; the "pins" are tabs that it presses down onto. The shape of the plastic keeps it from pulling "straight out", so don't force it. Just lift perpendicular to the wires, straight away from the board.
4. Buy a new caseback assembly (with battery) for 10 bucks on Aliexpress, eBay, Amazon, etc. Search for the part number "pd3032m".
5. Wait for shipping. 
6. Get impatient and desk-check the components you've got.
7. MAYBE you could get some life out of yours by connecting an external charger directly to the battery in-circuit, charging it up, then reassembling the watch. I knew mine was shot, though, so I broke the spot welds on the internal cell, and connected it to a lithium cell tester. Mine's a BT-C3100 v2.2, and I would recommend it.
8. Connect a fresh lithium cell to the + and - leads on the power supply board in the caseback. (Don't do this without removing the old cell first, or it can back-charge with unlimited current). Reconnect the 6-pin connector, and the watch should power on; you might have to hold the power button on the case.
9. Untested: if you reassemble the watch without a cell, it should be able to run on USB power, so you can get your files off the otherwise dead watch.
